BIS3214
=======

This readme file explains why we need this repository for our BIS3214 coursework 1.

For this coursework, the group will be creating different files, including the final report, sql files, diagrams, and so on. The group members may be all be editing the same file but working on different sections. For this reason it is important to have a good structure so they don't get lost.

### Some important definitions before we start:
>  - **Git** — The version control tool that GitHub is built on top of.
>  - **GitHub** — Our company and the name of our software. We build software and websites to help you interact with Git repositories in a nice way.
>  - **GitHub.com** — The website you log into to view repositories online.
>  - **GitHub Desktop** — An application that you can install on your computer to help you synchronize local code with GitHub.com.


### Guides
The [GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com/) are **very** good! It is better if you read all of them (for your own knowledge), but for the sake of the group work you will need to understand the following:

- [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) - Understand how we keep the files organised.
- [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) - Explains how you synchronise the [BIS code](https://github.com/criscmaia/BIS3214) to your computer.
- [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) - How we are going to keep track of what needs to be done
